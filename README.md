# WindowClassifier

A small CNN written in a night as a proof of concept for a ML-powered home-interior painting robot.

This neural net is a relatively rudimentary, binary output image classifier that is able to classify walls as windowed or windowless. After 20 epochs, and with somewhat poor training data, it operates at 97.5% efficacy. Surprisingly, this net is pretty consistent in recognizing the differences between artwork on a wall and a window on a wall.

If you take the time to look at this, please leave some feedback. Thanks!
